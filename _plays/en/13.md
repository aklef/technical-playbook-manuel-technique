When moving fast, we expect issues. We want to respond quickly, in a way that doesnâ€™t make the issue bigger and to not repeat the same problems so that our users are able to get reliable services.

### Skills to work on

1. Agree on what defines an incident and the levels of incident severity
1. Define an incident runbook: provide a list of clear steps to follow when an incident happens - it will bring us consistency and sets a quality standard
1. Always adopt a blameless approach and ensure psychology safety
1. Eliminate noise or false positives as soon as possible
1. Make your incident reports and action items visible
1. Automate the process: opening a bridge, creating the report, following up on action items, etc.
1. Clarify and simplify the communication channels when these incidents occur
