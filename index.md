# Technical Playbook

This playbook suggests what needs to be done to build effective digital services on a technical level.  It is opinionated, but backed by years of experience drawn from best practices in the private sector and government. It divides the software development discipline into 14 **actionable** plays. We do not enforce the plays onto any team, but strongly recommend them. At the CDS, we believe this playbook will help acheive the following:

- Set a Technical Standard baseline across our community and product teams 
- Increase collaboration and re-use
- Build speed and consistency
- Streamline onboarding of new developers, departments or partners
- Consolidate industry best practices and adapt them to our mission
- Realize economies of scale
- Mitigate risk and increase operational efficiency

We hope to refine it as we practice the plays everyday in our craft.
